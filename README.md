## KEY FEATURES
1. Bond-Aware pricing: Real-time bond pricing reflected. And for AMMs, price per token is not just adjusted based on supply/demand but adjusted for time-to-maturity and credit spread, keeping pricing closer to real-world bond risk profiles.
2. Price matching engine(Order book layer): Shows top selling bonds(most traded in pool)+ best bonds(highest yield/ lower risk, depending on the filter)
3. AI filtering and recommendations: AI bond screener takes yields, maturity, credit rating, liquidity score as input and outputs personalized bond baskets for retail investors(like a mutual fund screener but for bonds). Our AI Matching & Bargaining Bot suggests a fair midpoint or simulates bargaining when buyer and seller prices don‚Äôt match, giving retail users more control instead of blindly accepting AMM prices. In this hybrid execution, if AI can‚Äôt find a match the AMM provides instant liquidity, while successful matches enable tighter P2P trades. 
4. Dynamic pricing: ensures that larger trades impact price more than smaller ones, discouraging manipulation and protecting liquidity.
5. Liquidity pools for bonds: Investors and liquidity providers can contribute cash and tokenized bond fractions. AMM pool automates pricing and provides instant buy/sell without waiting for counterparties.
6. Permissioned and Compliant: this design is meant for regulated environments. It will support whitelisting of investors, custodial handling of bonds and compliance hooks.
7. Instant trading and transparency: Real-time quotes for buying/selling tokenized bonds. Also has full pool state and trade history viewable via API and UI.
8. Platform Fees: small fees per trade, according to platform/LPs. this will demonstrate sustainability and revenue model.

INTENDED USER:
1. Retail Investors(especially young and female investors in India): access to corporate bonds in fractional units, like buying a fraction of bond for Rs. 100 rather than Rs.10 lakhs. They can exit anytime via pool as well.
2. Liquidity Providers(LPs): Entities(banks, NBFCs, fintechs) or even sophisticated investors who want to earn fees by supplying bonds+ cash to pools
3. Regulated Institutions: Custodians, bond, issuers and rating agencies could integrate our product into their workings. The compliance teams will benefit from transparent pricing + easy audit of trade history.

FUNCTIONALITY
1. Onboarding & Compliance:
Users sign up through SEBI-compliant KYC/AML (via PAN, Aadhaar, CKYC). Investors are whitelisted before they can trade tokenized bonds.

2. Bond Tokenization & Fractional Ownership:
Corporate bonds are digitized into tokens (e.g., 1 bond = 1,000 tokens). Investors can buy fractions as small as ‚Çπ100, lowering entry barriers.

3. Hybrid Market Model
Order Book Matching: Shows live bids & asks, top selling bonds, and most liquid ones. AI Matching & Bargaining Bot: If bids/asks don‚Äôt align, AI suggests a midpoint or negotiates a fair trade. 
AMM Pool Backstop: If no P2P match is found, the AMM provides instant liquidity at pool price.

4. Price Discovery & Transparency
Real-time display of top bonds, yields, spreads, and liquidity scores. Investors see fair value pricing adjusted for maturity, rating, and credit spread.

5. Trading Execution
Buy Tokens: Users purchase fractional bond tokens instantly using cash balance.
Sell Tokens: Users can exit anytime by selling tokens either to other investors (P2P) or to the AMM pool.

6. Portfolio & Recommendations
Personalized bond suggestions using AI filtering (best match based on risk appetite, maturity, and returns).
Portfolio dashboard shows holdings, accrued coupon income, and exit options.

7. Liquidity Provider Features
Institutions/wealth managers can contribute bonds + cash to the AMM pool. Earn fees from trades and incentives for keeping spreads tight.

8. Audit & Compliance Tools
Every trade is logged immutably (blockchain-style ledger). Regulators/auditors can trace full transaction history ensuring trust & accountability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Backend: [your backend tech here, e.g., Django / Flask / Node.js]  
- Database: [e.g., MySQL / PostgreSQL]  

This project,s UI is built with:
- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
  
Our platform leverages a modern, hybrid technology stack to enable AI-driven bond recommendations, fractional ownership, and instant liquidity, while ensuring compliance and scalability. The frontend is built using React or Angular for responsive dashboards, real-time quotes, portfolio management, and AI-driven recommendations, integrating bond screening, trade history, and educational modules for a seamless experience. The backend uses Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js to manage business logic, user authentication, KYC/AML verification, bond tokenization, and trade execution. SQL/NoSQL databases store user profiles, trade history, liquidity pool states, and bond metadata. APIs handle communication with SEBI-compliant KYC providers, custodians, and market data sources. AI/ML models power the bond recommendation engine and Matching & Bargaining Bot, analyzing historical bond performance, yield curves, maturity, credit ratings, and liquidity metrics to suggest personalized baskets and fair trade midpoints. Machine learning also optimizes AMM pool pricing and risk management. Blockchain technology underpins fractional ownership, trade immutability, and audit trails. Bonds are tokenized into fractions, with all trades recorded on a permissioned blockchain for transparency and regulatory compliance. Smart contracts govern token transfers, liquidity pool interactions, and platform fees automatically. For analytics, charting libraries like D3.js or Recharts display spreads, liquidity, yield curves, and portfolio performance in real time. Cloud services such as AWS or Azure provide hosting, scalability, and security, while robust encryption ensures data privacy. Overall, our stack combines AI/ML for smart recommendations, blockchain for fractional ownership and auditability, web technologies for accessibility, and cloud infrastructure for scalability, creating a secure, transparent, and scalable ecosystem for corporate bond trading.
